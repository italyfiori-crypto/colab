00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
爱丽丝开始感到非常厌倦，坐在河岸边她姐姐旁边，无所事事：

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,275
once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
她一两次偷看了一眼姐姐正在读的书，但书里既没有图画也没有对话，

3
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:18,324
“and what is the use of a book, ” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations. ”
“没有图画或对话的书有什么用呢？”爱丽丝心想。

4
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:25,649
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
于是她开始在心里琢磨（尽管炎热的天气让她感到非常困倦和迟钝），

5
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:31,875
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
编织雏菊花环的乐趣是否值得她起身去摘那些雏菊。

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:36,049
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
突然，一只粉红眼睛的白兔从她身边跑过。

7
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,924
There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that;
这并没有什么特别引人注目的；

8
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:44,725
nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear. ”
爱丽丝也不觉得听到兔子自言自语说“哦，天哪”有什么特别奇怪的。

9
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:49,674
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
（事后回想起来，她觉得自己应该对此感到惊讶，

10
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:56,399
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_,
但当时这一切似乎都很自然）；然而，当兔子真的从背心口袋里掏出一块表时，

11
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,375
and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
爱丽丝站起身来，

12
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:06,325
for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
因为她突然想到，自己从未见过穿着背心口袋，

13
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:12,025
or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
或从口袋里掏出怀表的兔子，满怀好奇，她跑过田野追赶它，

14
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:17,375
and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
幸运的是，刚好看到它钻进树篱下的大兔子洞里。

15
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:24,075
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
下一刻，爱丽丝也跟着钻了进去，完全没考虑怎么再出来。

16
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:29,099
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,
兔子洞像隧道一样笔直延伸了一段，然后突然向下倾斜，

17
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:36,724
so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
如此突然，以至于爱丽丝还没来得及思考如何停下，就发现自己正在坠入一个非常深的井中。

18
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:40,474
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly,
要么是井非常深，要么是她坠落得非常缓慢，

19
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:46,349
for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.
因为她有充足的时间在下降过程中四处张望，并思考接下来会发生什么。

20
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:52,450
First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
首先，她试图向下看，想弄清楚自己会落到哪里，但那里太黑了，什么也看不见；

21
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,174
then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
然后她看了看井的两侧，发现那里装满了橱柜和书架；

22
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,974
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
她四处张望，看到墙上挂着地图和图片。

23
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:07,775
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”,
她经过时从其中一个架子上拿下一罐，标签上写着“橘子酱”，

24
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:14,974
but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath,
但令她非常失望的是，罐子是空的：她不想扔掉罐子，以免砸到下面的人，

25
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:19,224
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. ”
所以她在经过时设法把它放进了其中一个橱柜里。

26
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:25,650
thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs.
爱丽丝心想：“经过这次跌落，我觉得滚下楼梯也没什么大不了的。”

27
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,025
How brave they’ll all think me at home.
“在家的时候，他们一定会觉得我很勇敢。”

28
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:34,550
Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house. ” (Which was very likely true. )
“就算我从屋顶上掉下来，我也不会说什么的。”（这很可能是真的。）

29
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,099
Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end. “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time. ”
一直往下，往下，往下。这跌落什么时候才能结束？“我想知道现在我已经跌了多少英里了。”

30
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,574
she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
她大声说道：“我一定快到地球中心附近了。”

31
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:50,324
Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think— ” (for, you see,
让我想想：那应该是往下四千英里，我想——”（因为，你看，

32
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:54,800
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom,
爱丽丝在学校里学过这类东西，

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,349
and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her,
虽然这不是炫耀知识的好机会，因为没人听她说话，

34
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,375
still it was good practice to say it over) “— yes, that’s about the right distance—
但重复一遍还是很好的练习）“——是的，差不多是这个距离——

35
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:10,199
but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to. ”
但我不知道我现在是在什么纬度或经度。”

36
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:16,900
(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.
（爱丽丝完全不知道什么是纬度，也不知道什么是经度，但她觉得这些词说起来很气派。）
