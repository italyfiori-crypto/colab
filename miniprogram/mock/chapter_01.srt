00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,783
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
爱丽丝开始感到非常厌倦，坐在河岸边她姐姐身旁，无所事事：

2
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:11,807
once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
她一两次偷偷瞥了一眼姐姐正在读的书，但书里既没有图画也没有对话，

3
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:18,364
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
于是她在心里琢磨着（尽管炎热的天气让她感到昏昏欲睡且迟钝），

4
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:23,508
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
编织一个雏菊花环的乐趣是否值得她起身去摘那些雏菊，

5
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,920
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
就在这时，一只粉红眼睛的白兔突然从她身边跑过。

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,185
There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that;
这并没有什么特别值得注意的；

7
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:34,143
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
（事后回想起来，她觉得当时应该对此感到惊讶，

8
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:39,953
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_,
但当时这一切似乎都很自然）；然而，当兔子真的从背心口袋里掏出一块表，

9
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:43,658
and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
看了看，然后匆匆离开时，爱丽丝猛地站了起来，

10
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:48,536
for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
因为她突然想到，她从未见过有背心口袋的兔子，

11
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:53,840
or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
或者拿出一块表，她满怀好奇地跑过田野追赶它，

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,584
and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
幸运的是，她刚好及时看到它钻进篱笆下的大兔子洞里。

13
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:04,475
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
转眼间，爱丽丝也跟着钻了进去，完全没有考虑如何再出来。

14
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:08,899
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,
兔子洞像隧道一样笔直延伸了一段，然后突然向下倾斜，

15
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:15,243
so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
倾斜得如此突然，以至于爱丽丝还没来得及思考如何停下来，就发现自己正坠入一个很深的井里。

16
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:18,335
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly,
要么是井很深，要么是她下落得很慢，

17
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:24,678
for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.
因为她有充足的时间在下落时四处张望，并思考接下来会发生什么。

18
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:30,835
First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
首先，她试图向下看，想弄清楚自己会落到哪里，但那里太黑了，什么也看不见；

19
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:36,113
then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
然后她看了看井壁，发现上面满是橱柜和书架；

20
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:39,258
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
她还看到到处挂着地图和画作，挂在钉子上。

21
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:44,269
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”,
她经过时从架子上取下一个罐子，上面标着“橘子酱”，

22
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:50,319
but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath,
但令她大失所望的是，罐子是空的：她不想扔掉罐子，怕砸到下面的人，

23
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,797
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. ”
所以她在经过时设法把它放进了其中一个橱柜里。

24
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:59,968
thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs.
爱丽丝心想，“经过这次跌落，我觉得从楼梯上滚下来也没什么大不了的。”

25
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:02,313
How brave they’ll all think me at home.
“在家的时候，他们一定会觉得我非常勇敢。”

26
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:09,297
Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house. ” (Which was very likely true. )
“哎呀，我什么都不会说的，就算我从屋顶上掉下来。”（这很可能是真的。）

27
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:15,960
Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end. “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time. ”
往下，往下，再往下。这坠落难道永远不会结束吗？“我想知道现在我已经掉了多少英里了。”

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,118
she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
她大声说道。“我一定快接近地球的中心了。”

29
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:24,729
Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think— ” (for, you see,
“让我想想：那应该是四千英里深，我想——”（因为，你看，

30
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,541
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom,
爱丽丝在学校教室里学过一些这类的东西，

31
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:34,831
and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her,
虽然这不是一个展示她知识的好机会，因为没有人听她说话，

32
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,175
still it was good practice to say it over) “— yes, that’s about the right distance—
但重复一遍还是很好的练习）“——是的，这大概是正确的距离——

33
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:42,587
but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to. ”
但我不知道我现在是在什么纬度或经度。”

34
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:48,025
(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.
（爱丽丝根本不知道什么是纬度，也不知道什么是经度，但她觉得这些词说起来很气派。）
