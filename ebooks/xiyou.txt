《The Very Hungry Caterpillar》

In the light of the moon, a little egg lay on a leaf.

One Sunday morning, the warm sun came up and – pop! – out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.

He started to look for some food.

On Monday, he ate through one apple. But he was still hungry.

On Tuesday, he ate through two pears. But he was still hungry.

On Wednesday, he ate through three plums. But he was still hungry.

On Thursday, he ate through four strawberries. But he was still hungry.

On Friday, he ate through five oranges. But he was still hungry.

On Saturday, he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage, one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. That night, he had a stomachache!

The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf, and after that he felt much better.

Now he wasn’t hungry any more – and he wasn’t a little caterpillar any more. He was a big, fat caterpillar.

He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself. He stayed inside for more than two weeks. Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and…

He was a beautiful butterfly!

《Go Away, Big Green Monster!》

Big Green Monster has two big yellow eyes.
A long blueish-greenish nose.
A big red mouth with sharp white teeth.
Little squiggly ears.
And scraggly purple hair.

BUT…

You don’t scare me!

So go away, scraggly purple hair!
Go away, little squiggly ears!
Go away, long blueish-greenish nose!
Go away, big red mouth!
Go away, sharp white teeth!
Go away, two big yellow eyes!
Go away, Big Green Monster!

And don’t come back! Until I say so.

《Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes》

Pete the Cat was walking down the street in his brand-new white shoes.
Pete loved his white shoes so much, he sang this little song:
“I love my white shoes, I love my white shoes, I love my white shoes.”

Oh no! Pete stepped in a large pile of strawberries!
What color did it turn his shoes?
RED!

Did Pete cry? Goodness, no!
He kept walking along and singing his song:
“I love my red shoes, I love my red shoes, I love my red shoes.”

Oh no! Pete stepped in a large pile of blueberries!
What color did it turn his shoes?

Did Pete cry? Goodness, no!
He kept walking along and singing his song:
“I love my blue shoes, I love my blue shoes, I love my blue shoes.”

What color did it turn his shoes?
BROWN!

Did Pete cry? Goodness, no!
He kept walking along and singing his song:
“I love my brown shoes, I love my brown shoes, I love my brown shoes.”

Oh no! Pete stepped in a bucket of water!
And all the brown, and blue, and red got washed away.
His shoes were wet, but they were white again!

But then, what happened?
Pete stepped in another pile of strawberries? No...
He stepped in more blueberries? No...
He stepped in more mud? No...

He just kept walking along and singing his song.
Because it’s all good.
“I love my white shoes, I love my white shoes, I love my white shoes.”
